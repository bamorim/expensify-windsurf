# PRD: Advanced Policy Management

## Meta Information

- **Author**: Product Team
- **Status**: Draft
- **Priority**: P1
- **Target Release**: v3.0
- **Last Updated**: August 2025
- **Dependencies**: Core system (v1.0)

## Problem Statement

Basic per-category policies are insufficient for complex organizations. Need support for user groups, rolling time windows, and sophisticated policy hierarchies to match real-world approval workflows.

## Success Metrics

- **Policy Accuracy**: 95% of expenses route to correct approver
- **Admin Efficiency**: 50% reduction in policy setup time
- **Compliance Rate**: 98% policy compliance across all expense types
- **Rolling Limit Accuracy**: 99% accurate rolling window calculations

## User Stories

### Primary Use Cases

- As an **admin**, I want to create user groups so that I can apply policies to departments
- As an **admin**, I want to set rolling time limits so that spending is controlled over time periods
- As an **admin**, I want to configure policy conflict resolution so that overlapping policies are handled consistently
- As a **user**, I want to understand my current spending against limits so that I stay compliant

### Edge Cases

- User belongs to multiple groups with conflicting policies
- Rolling window calculations spanning fiscal year boundaries
- Policy changes affecting active rolling periods
- Complex group membership hierarchies

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### FR1: User Groups

- Admins can create/manage groups (Engineering, Sales, Executives)
- Users can belong to multiple groups
- Group-based policy targeting

#### FR2: Advanced Policy Targeting

- Organization-wide policies
- Group-based policies with AND/OR logic
- User-specific policies (single or multiple users)
- Clear specificity hierarchy

#### FR3: Rolling Time Windows

- Support for various periods (30-day, quarterly, annual)
- Real-time usage calculation against limits
- Historical spending aggregation

#### FR4: Policy Specificity Engine

- Scoring system for policy precedence
- Conflict resolution strategies (max/min/sum)
- Organization-configurable tie-breaking rules

#### FR5: Enhanced Policy Debugging

- Show all matching policies with scores
- Explain final policy selection
- Display current rolling window usage
- Preview approval decisions

#### FR6: Rolling Limit Calculations

- Efficient time-window queries
- Real-time usage updates
- Historical data retention for accuracy

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Policy resolution <500ms
- **Accuracy**: 100% accurate rolling calculations
- **Scalability**: Support 1000+ users per organization
- **Maintainability**: Clear policy evaluation logic

## Technical Considerations

- Complex database queries for rolling windows
- Policy evaluation performance optimization
- Group membership change handling
- Audit trail for policy changes
- Caching strategies for policy resolution

## Policy Specificity Hierarchy

1. User-specific (single user) - Highest
2. User-specific (multiple users) - By count
3. Group-specific (ALL groups) - By group count
4. Group-specific (ANY groups) - By group count
5. Organization-wide - Lowest
