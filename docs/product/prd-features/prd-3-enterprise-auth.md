# PRD: Enterprise Authentication (WorkOS)

## Meta Information

- **Author**: Product Team
- **Status**: Approved
- **Priority**: P0
- **Target Release**: v1.5
- **Last Updated**: August 2025
- **Dependencies**: Core system (v1.0)

## Problem Statement

Simple email authentication is insufficient for enterprise customers who require SSO, SAML integration, and centralized identity management. Need enterprise-grade authentication to enable larger customer adoption.

## Success Metrics

- **Enterprise Onboarding**: Enable 5+ enterprise customers in first quarter
- **SSO Adoption**: 80% of enterprise users use SSO login
- **Security Compliance**: Pass enterprise security audits
- **Login Success Rate**: 99% successful authentication rate

## User Stories

### Primary Use Cases

- As an **enterprise user**, I want to login with my company SSO so that I use familiar credentials
- As an **IT admin**, I want SAML SSO integration so that user access is centrally managed
- As a **user**, I want OAuth login options so that I can use Google/Microsoft accounts
- As an **organization admin**, I want to manage user roles so that access is properly controlled

### Edge Cases

- Users switching between multiple organizations
- SSO configuration changes affecting active sessions
- New users from enterprise domains
- Role conflicts between WorkOS and internal systems

## Requirements
