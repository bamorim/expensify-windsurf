## Problem Statement

Organizations need a streamlined system to manage employee expense reimbursements with proper policy enforcement, approval workflows, and audit trails. Current manual processes are time-consuming, error-prone, and lack transparency.

## Success Metrics

- **Time to Process Expense**: Reduce from 7 days to <2 days average
- **Policy Compliance**: 95% of expenses follow defined policies
- **User Adoption**: 80% of organization members actively using system
- **Auto-approval Rate**: 70% of compliant expenses auto-approved

## User Stories

### Primary Use Cases

- As an **employee**, I want to submit expense reimbursement requests so that I can get refunded for business expenses
- As an **admin**, I want to define expense policies so that spending is controlled and compliant
- As a **reviewer**, I want to approve/reject expenses so that only valid expenses are reimbursed
- As an **admin**, I want to invite users to my organization so that my team can use the system
- As a **user**, I want to understand which policy applies to my expense so that I submit compliant requests

### Edge Cases

- Multiple policies applicable to same user/category
- Expenses submitted without clear category match
- User belongs to multiple organizations
- Policy changes affecting pending expenses
