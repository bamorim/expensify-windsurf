# PRD: AI-Powered Receipt Processing

## Meta Information

- **Author**: Product Team
- **Status**: Approved
- **Priority**: P1
- **Target Release**: v2.0
- **Last Updated**: August 2025
- **Dependencies**: Core system (v1.0)

## Problem Statement

Manual expense entry is time-consuming and error-prone. Users need to type all expense details from receipts, leading to data entry errors and reduced adoption.

## Success Metrics

- **Data Entry Time**: Reduce from 3 minutes to <30 seconds per expense
- **Accuracy Rate**: 90% accurate OCR + LLM extraction
- **User Satisfaction**: 80% prefer receipt upload over manual entry
- **Processing Time**: Complete OCR + LLM analysis in <60 seconds

## User Stories

### Primary Use Cases

- As an **employee**, I want to upload receipt photos so that expense details are extracted automatically
- As an **employee**, I want to review and edit AI-extracted data so that I can correct any errors before submission
- As an **employee**, I want to track processing status so that I know when my receipt is ready for review

### Edge Cases

- Poor quality receipt images
- Receipts in multiple languages
- Complex receipts with multiple line items
- OCR processing failures

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### FR1: Receipt Upload

- Support PDF and common image formats (JPG, PNG)
- Immediate response with expense ID and "analyzing" status
- File size limits and validation

#### FR2: Asynchronous Processing

- Background OCR text extraction
- LLM-based structured data extraction (date, amount, category, description)
- Status updates from "analyzing" to "draft"

#### FR3: Expense State Management

- New states: analyzing → draft → submitted → approved/rejected
- State-specific validation rules
- Draft expenses allow incomplete data

#### FR4: Draft Review Interface

- Users can review AI-extracted data
- Edit any field before submission
- Clear indication of AI confidence levels
- Submit draft triggers existing approval workflow

#### FR5: Processing Status API

- Real-time status checking
- Progress indicators for long-running processes
- Error handling for processing failures

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Processing Speed**: <60 seconds for typical receipts
- **Accuracy**: 90% field extraction accuracy
- **Availability**: 99% uptime for processing services
- **Storage**: Secure receipt image storage with retention policies

## Technical Considerations

- Async job processing architecture (queues/workers)
- OCR service integration (Tesseract or cloud APIs)
- LLM API integration for structured extraction
- Image storage and processing pipeline
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
