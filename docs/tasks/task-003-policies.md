- [x] Auto-approval or manual review routing options implemented
- [x] Policy resolution engine determines applicable policy for user/category
- [x] Clear precedence rules (user-specific > organization-wide)
- [x] Policy debugging tool for transparency (via resolvePolicy endpoint)
- [x] Complete test coverage

- Policy resolution engine with debugging capabilities via resolvePolicy endpoint
- Comprehensive test suite with 9 passing tests covering all functionality
- Support for multiple policy periods (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
- Three review rules: auto-approve, manual review, and conditional approval
- Organization-scoped data isolation and proper error handling
**Blockers**: None - UI components remain to be implemented
**Next Steps**: Create policy management UI components for complete feature delivery
